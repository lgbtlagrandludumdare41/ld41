User Reference (to be printed at the start of the game)

TIED TO THE HANDLE OF THE MINESWEEPER IS A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT READS:
WANT TO MOVE?					<direction>
THINK THERE'S A MINE NEARBY?	f <direction>
NOT SURE ABOUT A LOCATION?		? <direction>
WANT TO REMOVE A MARK?			x <direction>

YOU CAN ONLY MOVE NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST, BUT OTHER ACTIONS CAN BE DONE DIAGONALLY.
YOU CAN'T MARK A LOCATION THAT YOU'VE ALREADY WALKED ON.
